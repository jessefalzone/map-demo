# "Cullboard" Demo

I built this site for the dev and ops team to track uploads, downloads, and other account activity occurring in their web app. 

The background is a stylized Google Map, upon which expanding circles are rendered to indicate the location and type of activity.

Stats would be updated in near-real-time, but this demonstration has only static figures.
